The above breakdown does vary slightly as we use different forms of connections and pipe sizing for different appliances.

While the installation of a gas cages is not always required, it may be used in certain circumstances. For example, if a gas cylinder is located under a window. A gas cage is used to reduce the horizontal distance between the window and the cylinder from 3 meters down to 600mm. This provides an additional layer of safety. If you dont need a cage but would like a cage installed with a new or existing installation for added protection, We offer a variety of gas cage sizes and styles.
New builds- Please notify your electrician/builder to follow the below regulation.

Electrical equipment, such as light switches and plugs, shall be at least 200mm away from any
burner and potential point of gas release. Where it is necessary to install a gas hob together with an
electric oven, a three-point plug socket shall not be used to connect the electric oven. A proper isolator switch shall be in place above the level of the hob and it shall have at least 200 mm
clearance from the hob.
No electrical connection shall be made below the hob. This will be in accordance with the requirements of SANS 10108.

The above breakdown does vary slightly as we use different forms of connections and pipe sizing for different appliances.

While the installation of a gas cages is not always required, it may be used in certain circumstances. For example, if a gas cylinder is located under a window. A gas cage is used to reduce the horizontal distance between the window and the cylinder from 3 meters down to 600mm. This provides an additional layer of safety. If you dont need a cage but would like a cage installed with a new or existing installation for added protection, We offer a variety of gas cage sizes and styles.
New builds- Please notify your electrician/builder to follow the below regulation.

Electrical equipment, such as light switches and plugs, shall be at least 200mm away from any
burner and potential point of gas release. Where it is necessary to install a gas hob together with an
electric oven, a three-point plug socket shall not be used to connect the electric oven. A proper isolator switch shall be in place above the level of the hob and it shall have at least 200 mm
clearance from the hob.
No electrical connection shall be made below the hob. This will be in accordance with the requirements of SANS 10108.
